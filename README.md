😎CHAINLINK CCIP MASTERCLASS🏅🌎


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Chainlink expands the capabilities of smart contracts by enabling access to real-world data and off-chain computation while maintaining the security and reliability guarantees inherent to blockchain technology.

This repo contains the Chainlink core node and contracts. The core node is the bundled binary available to be run by node operators participating in a decentralized oracle network. All major release versions have pre-built docker images available for download from the Chainlink dockerhub. If you are interested in contributing please see our contribution guidelines. If you are here to report a bug or request a feature, please check currently open Issues. For more information about how to get started with Chainlink, check our official documentation. Resources for Solidity developers can be found in the Chainlink Hardhat Box.
